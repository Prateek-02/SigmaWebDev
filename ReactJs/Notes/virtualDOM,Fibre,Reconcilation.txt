createRoot :- It creates a DOM like structure because it compares main DOM and Virtual DOM
            and update only those things which are updated in UI.
            Whereas Browser remove the whole DOM and again create it if there is any change.

Reconciliation:- It is an algo that react uses to differentiate one tree with another to determine which part is to be changed.(createROOT tree and Browser tree)

Fibre:- Pause the work and come back later.
        Assign priority to different types of work.
        Reuse previously completed work.
        Abort work if it's no longer needed.
